from src.job_analyzer import JobAnalyzer
from src.ai_optimizer import AIOptimizer
from src.job_applier import JobApplier
from src.database import DatabaseManager

async def main():
    # Initialize components
    db_manager = DatabaseManager()
    resume_parser = ResumeParser()
    job_analyzer = JobAnalyzer()
    ai_optimizer = AIOptimizer()
    job_applier = JobApplier()
    
    # Parse resume
    resume_path = "data/my_resume.pdf"
    resume_data = resume_parser.parse_resume(resume_path)
    
    # Analyze job
    job_url = "https://www.example.com/jobs/12345"
    job_data = job_analyzer.analyze_job_url(job_url)
    
    # Optimize resume
    optimized_resume = await ai_optimizer.optimize_resume(
        job_data['description'], 
        resume_data
    )
    
    # Apply to job
    result = await job_applier.apply_to_job(job_data, optimized_resume)
    
    # Save application
    db_manager.save_application_result(job_data, result)
    
    print(f"Application result: {result['status']}")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Ollama Setup

### System Requirements

To run Gemma 3.4b with Ollama, you'll need:

- **CPU**: A modern multi-core CPU (4+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: At least 5GB of free disk space
- **GPU (Optional)**: A CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM for faster inference

### Verifying Ollama Installation

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
ollama --version
```

You should see the version number displayed.

### Starting Ollama Server

If not already running, start the Ollama server:

```bash
ollama serve
```

### Testing the Model

Test if the model is working correctly:

```bash
ollama run gemma:3.4b "Hello, I'm looking for a job in software engineering. Can you help me optimize my resume?"
```

The model should respond with helpful advice.

### GPU Acceleration

If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU:

1. Make sure you have the latest CUDA drivers installed
2. Ollama should automatically use the GPU

To verify GPU usage:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

During model inference, you should see the Ollama process using GPU resources.

### Alternatives to Gemma 3.4b

If you have issues with the Gemma model, you can try these alternatives:

- `llama3:8b` - The Llama 3 8B model
- `mistral:7b` - The Mistral 7B model
- `phi3:3.8b` - The Phi-3 3.8B model

To use an alternative model, update your `.env` file:

```
GEMMA_MODEL=llama3:8b
```

Then pull the model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3:8b
```

## Prompt Templates

The prompts are organized in the `src/prompt_template.py` file and include:

1. **System prompts** - Define the AI's role and general behavior
2. **User prompt templates** - Dynamic templates for specific tasks
3. **Helper functions** - For generating formatted prompts

### Using Prompt Templates

```python
# Import system prompts directly
from src.prompt_template import AI_OPTIMIZER_PROMPT, JOB_ANALYZER_PROMPT

# Import template functions
from src.prompt_template import get_optimizer_prompt, get_job_analysis_prompt

# Generate a prompt for optimizing a resume
resume_text = "..."  # Original resume
job_description = "..."  # Job description
prompt = get_optimizer_prompt(resume_text, job_description)

# Use the prompt with the AI model
response = await call_ai_model(prompt)
```

### Customizing Prompts

You can customize the prompts to adjust the AI's behavior:

1. Edit the prompt constants in `src/prompt_template.py`
2. Create new template functions for specific use cases
3. Use environment variables to allow runtime configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Ollama Issues

If you encounter issues with Ollama:

1. Make sure Ollama is running:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. Verify the model is properly installed:
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```

3. Check the OLLAMA_API_URL in your .env file (default: http://localhost:11434)

### API Connection Issues

If the application can't connect to Ollama:

1. Make sure the Ollama server is running:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. Check if the API is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```

3. Verify the URL in your `.env` file matches the actual Ollama server address.

### Memory Issues

If you encounter out-of-memory errors:

1. Close other resource-intensive applications
2. Try using a smaller model like `gemma:2b` (though with reduced quality)
3. If using GPU acceleration, try switching to CPU-only mode

### Selenium/Playwright Issues

If you encounter issues with automated applications:

1. Make sure you have Chrome or Firefox installed
2. Try installing the browser drivers manually:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

3. Check your internet connection and job portal credentials

### Database Issues
```bash
# Delete database to reset
rm job_applications.db

# Restart application
python main.py
```

### Platform Login Issues
- Check credentials in .env file
- Verify account access
- Clear browser cache
- Check for CAPTCHA requirements

### Resume Parsing Issues
- Ensure file format is supported (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Check file permissions
- Verify file isn't corrupted
- Try different file formats

## Best Practices

### Resume Optimization
1. **Use Multiple Resumes**: Create different versions for different job types
2. **Update Regularly**: Keep resumes current with latest experience
3. **Keyword Matching**: Ensure resumes contain relevant keywords
4. **ATS Friendly**: Use standard formatting and avoid graphics
5. **Quantify Results**: Include numbers and metrics where possible

### Job Applications
1. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on relevant positions
2. **Customize Applications**: Tailor each application to the specific job
3. **Review Before Applying**: Always review auto-generated content
4. **Follow Up**: Track applications and follow up appropriately
5. **Maintain Records**: Keep detailed records of all applications

### Platform Usage
1. **Respect Rate Limits**: Don't exceed platform limits
2. **Use Real Information**: Provide accurate and truthful information
3. **Professional Profiles**: Maintain professional social media presence
4. **Network Actively**: Engage with industry professionals
5. **Stay Updated**: Keep profiles and resumes current

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- Store credentials securely in .env file
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Rotate passwords regularly

### Data Privacy

- No data transmitted to external services (except AI model)
- Resume content processed locally
- Application data encrypted in database

### Platform Compliance
- Follow platform terms of service
- Respect rate limits and usage policies
- Use legitimate automation practices
- Maintain professional conduct
